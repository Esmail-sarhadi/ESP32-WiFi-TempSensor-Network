# ESP32-WiFi-TempSensor-Network
A WiFi-based temperature and humidity monitoring system using ESP32 microcontrollers. This project consists of an ESP32 Access Point that receives data from one or more ESP32 Stations. The stations collect temperature and humidity data from DHT11 sensors and transmit it to the AP using UDP protocol.
